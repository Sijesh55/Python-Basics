OOPS CONCEPTS IN PYTHON

1.Inheritance
2.Encapsulation
3.Abstraction

I. What is Inheritance and how do python achieve Inheritance?
Inheritance is one of the OOPS concepts and it inheritance the property of super class. By using the keyword 'super'.
Assume, you have two class: super class and sub-class , here sub-class is Inheriting the properties of super class.

For instance, a child inheriting property from parent and child will have the same behaviour/property  a parent has.

II. What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the OOPS concepts and Binding the properties and behaviour inside a class is called Encapsulation.

3.Abstraction
In order to illustrate Abstraction, we take a real class example. Just consider a Car. We know how to drive a car, but moving  is an abstract feature here.
At the same instance, if you change the gear the Car accelerate/decelerate its speed.How do this happend? because its a hidden feature.At the same time if
you change the gear the Car will move forward/backwrd depends on it.
